Tomorrow Prep - 
	- Artifacts More Expensive Than Managers.
	- Add Store Items (?)
	- Premium Store and Ads

08/03/25 - ToDoList
	- Ad Popups: x2 income for 10 minutes; 'Auto Tap' for 2 minutes, Time Warp 30 minutes
	- Premium Currency Store and Powerups
	- Google Store Integration
	- Autobuy added to shop?
	- Save locally @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

08/03/25 - ToDoList
	- App Store Publishing
	- Marketing, Assets, and Description
	- Final Release!!!


ToDoList
- Daily Login Bonuses
- Unlock Animations
- Custom Icons!!!!

- PROGRESSION RATE + BALANCING (!important)
: x1 multiplier, more expensive upgrades? take it from there

Brainstorm:
	Another Main Menu Section
	More Items/Managers/Artifacts
	Infinite Progression Mechanics
inventory system?
premium store?

    1. Change premium store to get boosts from inventory/types
Store -> Inventory -> Mechanics
    1. Adjust Premium store layout + conditional checks 
    2. Integrate Inventory Items with game mechanics
    3. Adjust Admob rewards + reward chest ad
    4. Ensure items affect mechanics: Abilities, Managers, Artifacts, Boosts, Ads (no bugs)
    5. Check progression/balance/scaling
    6. Leveling system & rewards
    7. Microtransactions
Notes
    1. Premium store boosts buggy
    • + Max buys for no ads/auto buy/inventory
    • + negative gem values
    • + only certain purchases should be added to inventory
    1. Boosts not working on gameplay
    2. Rename only works while component is mounted = make global
    3. Level not increasing (no defined thresholds)


????
Achievement rewards + more of em
Upgrade boosts e.g. 100, 500, 1000 – Colour/Glow
Galactic Credits + New Planets
Drones/Ships
Customer Icons/Assets+





ideas - 
    • New Planet?
    • Powerups
    • Advanced Managers/Artifacts/Tech
    • Better Achievements
    • Graphics
    • Soundtrack
Questions
    • How do you earn skill points?
    • whats the milestone for a new world?
    • How can it be unique?
    • What makes the user feel powerful and motivated to explore?
    • What's the next breadcrumb?
    • How can I implement a social element and create competition? 
Notes
    • Should get you hooked. Progression should be challenging but rewarding. There should be something you're working towards that keeps your attention...
    • Plan out the user journey, ensuring they are constantly exposed to new features at a fun rate and don't get burnt out from over-exposure. 
    • Tune the mechanics so the Upgrades, Managers, Artifacts, and Abilities are affordable and balanced. 
    • Make sure there's an end game that's scalable or repeatable.

CPT + CPS
backend:

I'd be happy to explain how tap power and passive income (coins per second) are calculated in the game!

Tap Power (Coins Per Click)
Tap power is calculated based on several factors:

Base Click Value:

The base coinsPerClick value starts at 1.
Each upgrade you purchase adds its coinsPerClickBonus to this value.
In the click handler, this base value is multiplied by 2.5 to make clicking more rewarding.
Passive Income Bonus:

30% of your coins per second is added to each click, encouraging players to build passive income.
Income Multiplier:

The global income multiplier (affected by abilities) is applied to the click value.
Artifact Bonuses:

Artifacts like "Space Rocket" and "Molecular Flask" provide click multipliers.
Here's the relevant code from the handleClick function:


// In the 'CLICK' action case of gameReducer
const clickMultiplier = calculateClickMultiplier(state.ownedArtifacts);
  
// Base click value is 2.5x higher and includes 30% of coins per second
const baseClickValue = state.coinsPerClick * 2.5; 
const coinsPerSecondBonus = state.coinsPerSecond * 0.3;
const totalClickAmount = (baseClickValue + coinsPerSecondBonus) * (state.incomeMultiplier || 1) * clickMultiplier;
Passive Income (Coins Per Second)
Passive income is calculated through:

Base Passive Income:

Each upgrade contributes its coinsPerSecondBonus to your total.
This value is multiplied by 4x (in the 'BUY_UPGRADE' action) to make passive income more impactful.
Income Multiplier:

The global income multiplier (from abilities) is applied.
Tick Rate:

The income is further multiplied by 2x in the 'TICK' action (which runs 10 times per second).
This effectively makes the displayed CPS value accurate (0.5 * 4 * 2 = 4, combined with the 10 ticks per second).
Here's the key code for passive income calculation:


// In the 'TICK' action case
if (state.coinsPerSecond > 0) {
  const passiveAmount = (state.coinsPerSecond / 10) * (state.incomeMultiplier || 1) * 2; // 4x increase (0.5 * 4 = 2)
  newState = {
    ...newState,
    coins: newState.coins + passiveAmount,
    totalEarned: newState.totalEarned + passiveAmount
  };
}
Upgrade Effects
When purchasing upgrades:

The coinsPerClick increases by the upgrade's coinsPerClickBonus
The coinsPerSecond increases by the upgrade's coinsPerSecondBonus * 4 (the 4x multiplier makes passive income more valuable)

const newCoinsPerClick = state.coinsPerClick + (upgrade.coinsPerClickBonus * maxPossibleQuantity);
const newCoinsPerSecond = state.coinsPerSecond + (upgrade.coinsPerSecondBonus * 4 * maxPossibleQuantity); // 4x passive income boost
Ability Effects
Abilities can affect all these calculations through:

Direct increases to tap power
Reductions in upgrade costs
Boosts to passive income
Increases to the global income multiplier
Does this explanation help you understand how the game's economy works? Let me know if you need more specific details about any part of the calculation!
